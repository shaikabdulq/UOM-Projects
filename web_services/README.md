# Python Web Services and Data Processing
This repository showcases a collection of Python scripts demonstrating various aspects of web services and data manipulation. Each script is a standalone example of how to handle different data formats and interact with web services using Python. 

### Overview
The repository contains a series of Python scripts, and these scripts are arranged in order of increasing complexity.:

1. **xml_basic_parser.py:** Parses and prints information from a simple XML structure using xml.etree.ElementTree.
2. **xml_nested_structure_parser.py:** Extracts data from a slightly more complex XML structure, focusing on nested elements.
3. **json_basic_parser.py:** Demonstrates JSON parsing with a basic JSON object, extracting and printing specific fields.
4. **json_array_parser.py**: Works with a JSON array, iterating through items and printing specific details.
5. **complex_json_parser.py**: Parses a more complex JSON structure, typically resembling a response from a web API.
10. **xml_url_data_retrieval.py:** Demonstrates XML data retrieval from a URL and processes the XML response.
11. **json_url_data_importer.py:** Import JSON data from a URL and processes it.

### Installation and Usage
To use these scripts, you'll need Python 3.11 installed on your machine. No additional libraries are required for these scripts.
