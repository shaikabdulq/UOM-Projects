# University of Michigan - Python Specialization Projects

This repository contains all the projects I created as a part of the programming specialization at University of Michigan. There are individual readmes at each directory that the summarize the comprehensive learning journey undertaken during the 5-course programming specialization at the University of Michigan. Spearheaded by the esteemed Professor Charles Severance, the course provided an immersive experience in various aspects of programming, emphasizing hands-on learning through project assignments.

### Course Learning Outcomes

- **Advanced Programming Concepts:** Mastery of Python, with a focus on API services, database management, web networking, object-oriented programming, and data processing.
- **Practical Application:** Each project was designed to apply theoretical knowledge in real-world scenarios, enhancing problem-solving skills and technical proficiency.

### Project Highlights
- **Total Lines of Code:** Approximately 1000 lines, showcasing the depth and breadth of coding skills developed.
- **Database Integrations:** Multiple projects involved integrating databases, demonstrating proficiency in database management and SQL.
- **API Integrations:** Several assignments required the use of APIs, reflecting the ability to interact with various web services and process data efficiently.

### Grading Methodology
- **Auto-Grader System:** Projects were rigorously evaluated using an automated grading system, ensuring objective assessment of technical accuracy.
- **Peer-to-Peer Review:** Complementing the auto-grader, peer reviews fostered a collaborative learning environment, enhancing understanding through diverse perspectives.
