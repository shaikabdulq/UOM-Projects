# Python Object-Oriented Programming Examples

## Overview
This repository contains two Python scripts that illustrate the fundamentals of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python. These examples are designed for educational purposes to help new learners understand the concepts of classes, objects, inheritance, and basic class functionalities in Python.

### class_object_example.py: 
This script defines a 'PartyAnimal' class that models a party attendee. The class includes methods to increment a counter each time the attendee parties (i.e. party()) and a destructor that prints a message when an object is destroyed.
##### Key Concepts:
- Class creation 
- object instantiation
- method definition 
- destructor.

### class_inheritance_example.py:
Extends the class_object_example.py script by adding a 'FootballFan' class that inherits from 'PartyAnimal' class. It includes additional functionality specific to a football fan, such as a method that keeps track of points (i.e. touchdown()).
##### Key Concepts:
- Inheritance
- extending classes
- overriding methods.

### Requirements
- Python 3.11
